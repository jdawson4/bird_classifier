The goal with this repo is simple: prove Mr. XKCD wrong!

If you're unfamiliar with what I'm talking about, XKCD published a webcomic on September 24, 2014, titled "Tasks" (available here https://xkcd.com/1425/). XKCD's joke calls GIS easy (debatable), but more importantly, describes "check[ing] whether [a] photo is of a bird" as "virtually impossible", suggesting that one would need "a research team and five years" to accomplish it. I love this comic, because I frequently have to describe certain computational tasks as virtually impossible, *but*, computer vision has made great stride in the now ten years since that comic was published. In this repo, we will complete the "virtually impossible" task with some beginner-level deep learning. In fact, we'll be doing something a bit harder than deciding if an image if *of* a bird, we'll be classifying the bird by species!
